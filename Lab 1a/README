lab1a.c:
This file contains the program as described by the specification. I chose a buffer size of 1024 as recommended. My program includes some global variables that need be accessed by different functions. In addition to the system calls mentioned in the specification, I also used dup2 and atexit, which helped me simplify the process of duplicating file descriptors and doing cleanup and restoration upon exiting the program. 
   
Makefile:
This file contains the following targets.
default: This builds the executable with gcc and option -g.
clean: This removes the executable, any .o files, and the distribution tarball, thus returning the directory to its original state.
dist: This builds the distribution tarball.

README:
This file provides a description of each included file.

References:
I used code from the following site as a reference for how to use pipe as well as fork.

I found out how to use dup2 using this page, which helped simplify my duplication of standard input, standard output, and standard error of the shell to the appropriate pipes.

I learned how to use atexit using this page, which made restoring terminal modes and cleaning up at exit much easier.

I found an example of how to use poll from the following site
