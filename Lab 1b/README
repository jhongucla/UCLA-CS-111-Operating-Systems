lab1b-client.c:
This file contains the program that acts as the client which connects to the server program. In the client program, I implemented the <cr> or <lf> mapping to <lf> when sent through the socket. The client terminal still outputs both <cr> and <lf>.

lab1b-server.c:
This file contains the program that acts as the server program which connects to the client program. In the server program, I implemented mapping <lf> from the shell to <cr> and <lf> before sending through the socket. 

Makefile:
This file contains the following targets.
default: calls the client and server targets to build the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables
client: builds the lab1b-client executable with the -libmcrypt flag 
server: builds the lab1b-server executable with the -libmcrypt flag
clean: This removes the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables and the distribution tarball, thus returning the directory to its original state.
dist: This builds the distribution tarball.

README:
This file provides a description of each included file.
